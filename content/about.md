## Hi, I'm LondoSpark

You will often find me doing random projects in all manner of languages and frameworks, from **C#** and **.NET** through to the functional first fun of **F#**, all the way to the pure beauty of **Ruby** then dropping through the layers down to languages like **Rust** and **Odin** stopping off at **Kotlin** for some Android development on the way.

Sometimes I can be found streaming these escapades over on [twitch](https://twitch.tv/londospark) where I try to explain what I'm doing and learn about things live with help from the community!
